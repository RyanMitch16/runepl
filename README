Arrays objects can be created through syntax or through the array function call.

	var a = [1, 2, this, 4, "Hello", 6]

	var b = array(10) //Initialized to a size of 10 filled with nulls


Arrays can be accessed using brackets and the first index starts from 0.

	print(a[0]) //prints 1
	print(a[4]) //prints Hello

	print(b[0]) //prints null because arrays spots are initialized to null


Arrays have a length member that gives the size of the array.

	print(a.length) //prints 6
	print(b.length) //prints 10
